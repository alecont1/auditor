- Logged in as admin@testcompany.com
- Navigated to Company Settings
- Changed company name and saved
- Verified "Company settings saved successfully" message displayed
- Reverted company name back to original

### 3. Feature #185: Stripe Checkout Flow (SKIPPED)
- Reviewed implementation - code is complete
- Backend: POST /api/tokens/checkout creates Stripe sessions
- Backend: POST /api/tokens/webhook handles payment completion
- Frontend: TokensPage redirects to Stripe or falls back to dev mode
- **Blocker**: Requires STRIPE_SECRET_KEY and STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET

   - Dev fallback: Working (tested with simulated purchase)

2. **Feature #188: PDF chunking for large files**
   - Implementation: Would need Claude API integration
   - Missing: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
   - Current behavior: Files up to 100MB accepted, processing simulated

## Test Verification
- Login flow: ✅ Working
- Company settings save: ✅ Shows success message
- Token purchase (dev mode): ✅ Balance updated, transaction recorded

To complete the remaining 2 features, configure these environment variables:

1. For Stripe checkout (Feature #185):
   ```
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxx
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxx
   ```

2. For PDF chunking (Feature #188):
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxx
   ```

Then:
- Test Stripe checkout flow with test card (4242 4242 4242 4242)
